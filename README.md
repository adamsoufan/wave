# Wave Gestures

![Wave Gestures Logo](renderer/assets/images/wave.png)

Wave is a desktop application that allows you to control your computer using hand gestures detected through your webcam. Create custom macros, map them to specific hand gestures, and execute commands without touching your keyboard or mouse.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Detection**: Detects gestures like open hand, pinched fingers, OK sign, peace sign, point up, point down, thumbs up, and thumbs down
- **Custom Macro Creation**: Create sequences of actions that can be triggered by gestures
- **Multiple Action Types**:
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Command line commands
- **Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface for managing mappings and macros
- **System Tray Integration**: Runs in the background with tray icon access
- **Toggle Control**: Enable/disable specific gesture mappings as needed

## Demo

When running, Wave Gestures can detect the following gestures:

- ‚úã Open Hand
- ü§å Pinched Fingers
- üëå OK Sign
- ‚úåÔ∏è Peace Sign
- üëÜ Point Up
- üëá Point Down
- üëç Thumbs Up
- üëé Thumbs Down

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Node.js 20+ installed (20 is recommended)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- C++ Build Tools for Windows (not the full Visual Studio IDE)
  - Required for compiling native modules like RobotJS
  - Download the "Build Tools for Visual Studio" from the [Visual Studio Downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  - During installation, select only the "Desktop development with C++" workload
- Webcam connected to your computer

**Important Note About RobotJS**: RobotJS has known compatibility issues with newer versions of Node.js and Electron. If you encounter problems when building, you may need to use electron-rebuild or follow specific instructions for rebuilding RobotJS for your Node.js/Electron version. See [RobotJS Electron Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Electron) for more details.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamsoufan/wave.git
cd wave
```

### Step 2: Install JavaScript Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## Building the Application

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up Your First Gesture Macro

1. **Create a Macro**:

   - Go to the Macro Hub page
   - Click "New Macro"
   - Name your macro (e.g., "Volume Up")
   - Add actions (e.g., a key press action for volume up key)
   - Save the macro

2. **Map a Gesture to Your Macro**:

   - Go to the Mapping Hub page
   - Click "New Mapping"
   - Select your macro from the dropdown
   - Give the mapping a name
   - Click on the hand icon to select a gesture (e.g., Thumbs Up)
   - Save the mapping

3. **Use Your Gesture**:
   - Go to the Home page
   - Click "Start Detecting"
   - Perform the gesture in front of your webcam
   - The action will be executed

### Example: Media Controls

Create macro for:

- Play/Pause (Space key)

Map them to:

- Thumbs Up gesture for Play/Pause

## Project Structure

- `main.js`: Main Electron process
- `preload.js`: Preload script for renderer process
- `renderer/`: UI files
- `gesture-detection/`: Python scripts for gesture detection
  - `Detector.py`: Main detector script
  - `hand_gesture_knn_model.pkl`: Trained model for gesture recognition

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Electron, Node.js
- **Gesture Detection**: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, scikit-learn
- **OS Integration**: RobotJS

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues

- Ensure your webcam is properly connected
- Verify webcam permissions are enabled for the application
- Try using a different camera by changing the `CAMERA_INDEX` in `gesture-detection/Detector.py`

### Detection Problems

- Ensure good lighting in your environment
- Position your hand clearly in front of the camera
- Try restarting the detection process

### Macro Execution Issues

- Verify the macro is correctly defined
- Check if the mapping is enabled (toggle is ON)
- Ensure the target application is in focus when needed
